Setup partially complete!

Due to the large size of the project, you'll need to:

1. Copy the remaining files from our conversation
2. The structure is ready, just add the code

Key files still needed:
- backend/main.py
- backend/logger.py
- backend/models/chat.py
- backend/services/*.py
- backend/api/*.py
- backend/services/tools/*.py
- frontend/index.html
- frontend/style.css
- frontend/app.js

Or ask me to create a Part 2 script with the remaining files!
